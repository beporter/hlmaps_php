DESCRIPTION
-----------
HLmaps is a Perl script set for Linux, FreeBSD and WinNT Half-Life game 
server admins written by Scott McCrory. The PHP release is written by Brian 
Porter. It allows web site visitors to view all your loaded maps, screen shots, 
download links for maps, and some file statistics in a highly customizable 
output page. In the PHP version, HTML is used for output structure, and CSS is 
used for style. See STYLES101 for more on this.

HLmaps should be pretty safe to use, as Perl's "warn" and "taint" modes are 
implemented(although NT ActiveState Perl users may need to remove the -T).
Processing loads are not very noticable now that the package uses a scheduled job
to parse the logs into an interrim file or optional MySQL database, and the
run-time PHP script gets its info from this file/database when displaying the
output to the user.

REQUIRES
--------
  + Linux, FreeBSD or WinNT
  + Perl 5.0+  (Ships with nearly every *nix distribution) or ActiveState's
    Perl for WinNT)
  + Web server supporting PHP 4+ (Apache and Microsoft IIS both support PHP)
  + MySQL if you want to use a database as the interrim data store (optional)
  + Half-Life Server software (well duh!)

DOWNLOADING
-----------
Home page:
      http://hlmaps.sourceforge.net

INSTALLING
----------
Please read the INSTALL file in this package for installation and upgrade info.

CONTRIBUTING
------------
If you're interested in contributing to HLmaps, by all means study this
package and check out the home page at http://hlmaps.sourceforge.net where
you'll find a link to the CVS tree, developer mailing lists, etc. I sure
could use help with everything from bug fixes to additional map images to
additional platform ports to documentation to optimizing code to
adding features...!

Hope you enjoy!
Scott and the HLmaps development team.
