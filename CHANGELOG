---------------------------------------------
- bugfix, + enhancement, * contrib, = RELEASE
---------------------------------------------

= 2.0 3/07/2002
  = First release of PHP port based on Perl v1.1. All features currently
    available in the Perl release are implemented in the PHP release.
  + PHP release includes major enhancements in output customization over the 
    Perl release. Uses HTML templates for structural formatting on the output 
    page, and cascading stylesheets for visual styling. The .conf file is much
    shorter as a result.
  + PHP release now uses qstat for live server status.
  * PHP release contributed by Brian Porter (beporter@users.sourceforge.net)

= 1.1 03/27/2001
  = This release is specifically to allow operation with hlds 1.1.0.6+ servers.
  * Merged Michael Park's update of Rod May's kkrcon code to determine currently
    running map from hlds 1.1.0.6+ servers (thanks Michael!)
  - Changed hlmaps.conf.distrib file to search for "Loading map" instead of
    "Spawning Server" for indication of map load in 1.1.0.6+ servers.

= 1.0 10/23/2000
  = I'm calling this 1.0 because it has all the features (and it looks like the
    stability) of a 1.0 release.  Future work will most likely be aimed at bug
    fixes and small enhancements.
  + Integrated Rod May's kkrcon code to show which map is currently in play.
    Also added integration with real-time stats programs like csserverstat.
    The combination of these features means you can click on the map in play
    and go to the real-time information for the server!
  + Clicking on the single-map screen's map image will return the user to the
    main maps list.
  - Remarked out the "use DBI;" lines in hlmaps.pl and hlmaps.cron to quash
    the error that non-DB users were getting.  If anyone knows how to properly
    load DBI at runtime without warnings, please let me know.  As per the
    INSTALL.MySQL file, DB users will now need to unremark these two lines.
  - Cleaned up some code, comments and docs.

= 0.95 09/24/2000
  + Added optional MySQL support as the storage medium for the interrim data.
    This should give others the ability to write applications which will use
    the data collected by hlmaps.cron.  Go to it developers!
  - Fixed bug where default maps/page wasn't being read (handled) correctly
    from hlmaps.conf file.
  - Improved resilience to mapcycle.txt files that have extra (DOS) characters
    in them - thanks Ludwig Nussel for the regex!
  - Fixed problem with number of pages calculation.  If the number of maps div
    by the maps per page equaled an even number, we'd add a blank page to the
    end.  Not anymore, thanks to Jon Adams!

= 0.94 08/05/2000
  * Thanks to Justin Harris, Matthew McClendon and Matt Chambers for many
    ideas behind this release...
  - Fixed a bug where the number of maps displayed was 1 less than the number
    specified (i.e. 9 instead of 10).
  - Set default values for many variables in case they're not specified in the
    .conf file.  This can happen when a user forgets to update their .conf
    after upgrading HLmaps and there are additional variables.
  - Script was only reading the name of the first game session listed in each
    log file when determining map popularity.  Now it should pick up multiple
    map loads within a log file. - thanks Matthew McClendon!
  + HLmaps now uses a cron script to gather information from the log files,
    mapcycle, map directory, download directory and txt files.  This is to
    greatly improve the run-time performance of HLmaps (many servers had over
    10 meg of logs to parse for each web hit!) and to make it easier for the
    future addition of MySQL support.  See the INSTALL file for details.
  + Now printing nav bar below the map table in addition to the one above.
  + Added {A} for ascending and {D} for descending sort order indication.
  + You can now specify a "no maps available" image in place of the text
    message using a hlmaps.conf variable.  This can be used to force all the
    columns to be the same height.
  + Added variable in .conf for built-in maps (these are ones which don't have
    external .bsp files - they're integrated into the mod)
  + Added a separate single-map view with the map.txt file, download link,
    image, stats, etc.  This now serves as the jump-off point for downloads
    instead of direct links from the main results table.
  + Added drop-down widget to let user change number of maps displayed/page.
  + Added documentation to the .conf file to make it clearer.

= 0.93 07/25/2000
  * Thanks to Martin Hömberg for many ideas behind this release...
  + Confirmed NT portability - admins will just have to remove the "-T" on the
    script's "shebang" line to make it work under ActiveState Perl.  Martin
    gets big kudos for testing and offering solutions for this.
  + Internationalized HLmaps output - use the .conf file to make it print the
    output in your language.
  + Map image now links to the download package if one exists.
  + Added .conf option for different download extension in case you make your
    maps downloads available in .arj, .arc, .gz, etc.
  + Added color to table header row to indicate current sort order.
  + Added indication of what position a map is in the mapcycle.
  + Added ability to specify number of maps per page displayed, as well as the
    paging navigation bar.  This should be great for servers with tons of
    maps and 56k modem clients who don't want to wait for pages to load.

= 0.92 07/22/2000
  - Fixed problem where a DOS-edited mapcycle with carriage returns would
    prevent HLmaps from understanding it correctly.  Should work fine now.
  - Now only using Perl-internal dir and file access functions instead of the
    kludgy "ls" that I was using.  Should make porting to NT easier.
  + HLmaps now uses a separate /etc/hlmaps.conf file for more flexible editing
    of preferences and easier script upgrades.  Note that users running mult-
    iple instances of HLmaps on the same system will want to edit the script's
    $CONF_FILE variables to point to seperate hlmaps.conf files.
  + The INSTALL file was updated with the new procedures now that we have a
    separate hlmaps.conf file.
  + User can now sort by map modification date/time.
  + Imported project into SourceForge's CVS repository.
  + Again tested OK with Apache/mod_perl's "PerlRun" compatability mode.
    This is now part of my standard testing procedures and is probably as far
    as I'll ever get to true mod_perl unless someone want to help.

= 0.91 07/21/2000
  - Fixed problem where cat | grep could only handle up to 1500 line files
    by using Perl internal file access -- Glen Muras.
  + Tested OK with Apache/mod_perl's "PerlRun" compatability mode.

= 0.90 07/20/2000 -- Scott (smccrory@users.syshealth.net)
  First public release.
